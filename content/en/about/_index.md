Amanda Park currently works as a Data Scientist at Spectrum Health. She uses the statistical programming languages R and Python to transform data into actionable insights for a large healthcare organization. Over the course of the past 2 years, she has worked on pivotal analytics projects including predicting when the surge for COVID-19 patients will hit.

She obtained her Master's in Statistics from Binghamton University in May 2019 and was previously the president of the Board of Directors for Youth Power, a nonprofit organization that advocates for youth rights. She believes that everyone's voice deserves to be heard and champions for equality across all realms. Outside of work, she is found working on video game development, reading, and/or rooting for the hapless New York football Giants.
