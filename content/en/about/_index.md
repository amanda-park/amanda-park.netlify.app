Amanda Park currently works as a Data Scientist at Spectrum Health. She uses statistical programming languages R and Python to transform data into actionable insights for a large healthcare organization, and has worked on pivotal analytics projects, such as predicting when the surge for COVID-19 patients will hit.

She previously obtained her Master's in Statistics from Binghamton University in May 2019 and was the president of the Board of Directors for Youth Power, a nonprofit organization that advocates for youth rights. She believes that everyone's voice deserves to be heard and champions for equality across all realms. Outside of work, she is found either reading a book, dabbling in a nerdy hobby, or trying to muster up the motivation to actually go exercise.
