## R Projects

* __*EasyTidyModels*__ is an R package developed to make analyses using the tidymodels framework both simpler and more reproducible.
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/easytidymodels)
  * [Documentation](https://amanda-park.github.io/easytidymodels/)

* __*REasyEDA*__ is an R package developed to make exploratory data analysis easier. Quickly create visualizations of your data, explore transformations for normalization, and check both correlations and predictive power score. Currently in development.
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/reasyeda)

* The [__*Pokemon Analysis*__](https://github.com/amanda-park/Pokemon-Analysis) repository hosts various R projects where I've analyzed Pokemon related data. Examples:
  * **Pokemon Binary Classifcation Analysis**: 
    * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/Pokemon-Analysis/tree/main/Binary%20Classification%20-%20Pokemon)
    * [ShinyApps Deployment](https://amandapark.shinyapps.io/PokemonAnalysis/)
  * **Pokedex Shiny Application**
    * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/Pokemon-Analysis/tree/main/Shiny%20App%20-%20Pokemon%20%26%20Pokedex)
    
* This website itself is an R Project! It was built in blogdown using Hugo as a framework.
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/amanda-park.netlify.app)
  
## Python Projects

* __*EasyPlotly*__ is a Python repo developed to make interactive visualizations using the Plotly framework simpler. The main need met by this tool was to standardize visualizations for leadership regardless of whether R or Python was used. Currently in development.
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/easyplotly)
  * [Documentation](https://easyplotly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Java Projects

* __*Mental Health Guidebook*__ was an Android application I developed in 2019 that gives an overview of various therapy modalities and exercises one can do to improve their mental health. 
  * [Google Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amanda.mentalhealthguide)
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/mental-health-guidebook)
    * _Note: If I were to redo the project now I would handle things much differently knowing about version control and object-oriented programming. However, despite the disorganization on the backend when developing this, the app still runs well._
