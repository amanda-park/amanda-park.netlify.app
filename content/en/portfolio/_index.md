## R Projects

* __*EasyTidyModels*__ is an R package developed to make analyses using the tidymodels framework both simpler and more reproducible.
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/easytidymodels)
  * [Documentation](https://amanda-park.github.io/easytidymodels/)

* The [__*Tidy-Tuesday*__](https://github.com/amanda-park/Tidy-Tuesday) repository hosts various R projects worked on starting in grad school. Notable finds:
  * **Pokemon Binary Classifcation Analysis**: 
    * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/Tidy-Tuesday/tree/main/Binary%20Classification%20-%20Pokemon)
    * [ShinyApps Deployment](https://amandapark.shinyapps.io/PokemonAnalysis/)
  * **Twitter Natural Language Processing Analysis**:
    * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/Tidy-Tuesday/tree/main/NLP%20-%20Personal%20Twitter%20Tweets)
    * [ShinyApps Deployment](https://amandapark.shinyapps.io/TwitterAnalysis/)

* This website itself is an R Project! It was built in blogdown using Hugo as a framework.
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/amanda-park.netlify.app)
  
## Python Projects

* __*EasyPlotly*__ is a Python repo developed to make interactive visualizations using the Plotly framework simpler. The main need met by this tool was to standardize visualizations for leadership regardless of whether R or Python was used. Currently in development.
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/easyplotly)
  * [Documentation](https://easyplotly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Java Projects

* __*Mental Health Guidebook*__ was an Android application I developed in 2019 that gives an overview of various therapy modalities and exercises one can do to improve their mental health. 
  * [Google Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amanda.mentalhealthguide)
  * [Github Repo](https://github.com/amanda-park/mental-health-guidebook)
    * _Note: If I were to redo the project now I would handle things much differently knowing about version control and object-oriented programming. However, despite the disorganization on the backend when developing this, the app still runs well._
