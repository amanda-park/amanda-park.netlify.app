I've always toyed with the idea of setting up a blog to write my thoughts out to the world, and now I have mustered up the desire to do so! I have a lot of ideas I'm itching to blog about (both personally and professionally), so I look forward to writing for you all!

Thanks to this [post](http://www.jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for helping me set this up. I can now easily develop posts in Markdown rather than navigate one of the popular blogging platforms.
