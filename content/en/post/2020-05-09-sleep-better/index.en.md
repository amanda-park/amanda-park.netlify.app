Over the years I've gotten better at getting consistently good nights of sleep. Here are a few tips you can implement that may help you wake up ready to tackle the world when your alarm goes off:

### Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day

I know this one is the one I struggle with most personally. Growing up, I was always the type to sleep in on weekends as I never fully rested and awake when I woke up in the mornings for school. It feels mentally satisfying to get those extra hours.

But it's not physically satisfying. A body's internal clock doesn't care if it's a Wednesday or Sunday; it wants to go at its own rhythm. By having unpredictable times of waking up and going to bed your body will inevitably get thrown off track when you stay up hours late on weekends and sleep in to make up for it. 

This one can be really hard to follow if your social circle tends to stay up later. I know I've fallen prey to staying up late to socialize myself, and sometimes that need is more important to fill than getting 8 hours of sleep. The important thing is to be aware of the tradeoff being made when you stay up late to do other things. 

### Sleep in a completely dark room

I make sure to sleep in a room that doesn't have any light sneak into it, whether it be from electronics or from a completely open window. The complete darkness really helps my brain to turn off and to think about sleep. Blackout curtains and unplugging any electronics that emit light before bed are incredibly helpful for this purpose.

### If you can't fall asleep after lying in bed for 20 minutes, get up and do something else

Laying around in bed and not sleeping will just cause your brain to associate your bed with overthinking. Reading a book, doing chores, or any other low-impact activity can help lull your brain back into wanting to go back to sleep.

### Stop drinking caffeine after lunch

I've mentioned this in a previous blog post, but caffeine has a half-life of 6 hours. You don't want that in your system as you're trying to go to sleep, because even if you are able to go to sleep, you won't be able to get as refreshing and restorative of sleep as you would have without the caffeine there.

### Reduce alcohol consumption

I may admittedly be very sensitive to the effects of alcohol, but every time I drink I notice that the quality of my sleep the following night is always way worse than I expect it'd be. My brain feels like it can only run at 80% capacity. 

While alcohol is a depressant and can make you drowsy, the sleep you get when drinking isn't as restorative as sleep you would get completely sober. Alcohol messes with melatonin production, and by throwing that off your circadian rhythm also is less consistent. 

### Reduce blue light usage before bed

I know the general advice is to just not use electronics at all an hour before bedtime, but I've honestly found it pretty unrealistic to stick to that goal. It'll be best for your sleep if you can get off your electronics and just do something such as read a book before bed (even on something like a Kindle).  However, if you're like me and unable to quit using your computer right before bed, there are some ways around it that will help you sleep better:

* Use a program like [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) that will auto-adjust your computer screen's brightness when the sun goes down and reduces the blue light emitted from your monitor. Also getting something like this for your phone is recommended.
* Turn down your monitor's/phone's brightness in general. I've found it's helped my general eye strain to keep things dimmer.
* Don't do anything intense on your electronics before bed. Usually I wind down with some writing or watching a TV show; I'm certainly not going all-out right before I catch some z's. 

### Limit liquids a couple of hours before sleep

There's a fine line to this one. You don't want to go to bed dehydrated, but you also don't want to wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. I've found the best balance for this is to drink plenty of water earlier in the day, and then taper off once evening hits. 

(If you also struggle with heartburn, I recommend not eating a couple of hours before bed and sleeping with a raised pillow as you sleep.) 

### Use a wake-up light alarm clock

This one has probably been the biggest game changer for me. It's a lot easier for me to wake up with a slowly-brightening light rather than a jarring alarm forcing me awake in the middle of my sleep cycle. The light alarm I have gently nudges me awake over a period of 30 minutes, and usually within the first 15 minutes of the light being on I start to wake up. Rarely does it get to the point where the alarm in the clock also goes off to give an auditory cue to wake up. If snoozing your alarm makes you miserable in the morning, this may be a better alternative to ensure your mornings start off on the right foot. 

## Conclusion

There are other suggestions that are thrown out there regarding how to sleep better that I haven't found hold for me. Feel free to also consider these options in your journey:

1. Sleep in a cold room
2. Sleep without socks and/or with a foot outside the covers
3. Sleep in a certain position
4. Shower before bed
5. Use bedroom for sleep (and sex) only
6. No vigorous exercise right before bed
7. Journal before bed
8. Sleep alone

May better sleep be in everyone's future!
