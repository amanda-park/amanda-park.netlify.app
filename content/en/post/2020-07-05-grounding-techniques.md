With the state of the world still being what it is, it's easy to feel disconnected from our bodies. Grounding is a very important practice that we should all use on a regular basis, even when we're not living through history. Below I’ll list a few of my favorite techniques I've used in the past to stay in the present moment (these can be done in quick succession or separately, depending on personal preferences):

### Awareness of the Environment

Set your phone down (or turn off whatever electronic device you are using) for a second and become aware of your surroundings. Notice as much as you can about what you can see, hear, touch, taste and smell. Ask yourself the following:
* What’s the temperature?
* Is the air moving or still?
* What is the lighting like?

Count at least five sounds you can hear, five objects you can see and five things you can feel that are currently against your body (such as how your shirt feels, the air on your face, your feet on the floor, your back against the chair, etc). Notice what happens.

 ### Awareness of the Body

Focus your attention on your body. Notice where your legs and arms are and the position of your spine. Scan your body internally from head to toe; notice what you can feel throughout your body. Put your phone down, close your eyes and do this for a minute.

### Awareness of The Breath

Connect with your breathing patterns. Notice the rise and fall of your rib cage and the air moving through your nose. Follow the air in through your nose. Notice your lungs expanding and your abdomen pushing outward. Feel the air leave as the lungs deflate. Set aside any distractions, close your eyes and do this for a minute.

### Awareness of Sounds

Focus on the sounds you can hear. Notice the sounds coming from you, the sounds coming from the room and the sounds coming from outside the room. Close your eyes and do this for a minute and see what happens.

### Notice Five Things

This exercise helps to center yourself and connect with your environment. Practice it a few times every day, especially whenever you find yourself getting caught up in your thoughts and feelings. You’ll find that it brings you back to the here and now. The steps include:

* Pause for a moment.
* Look around and notice five objects you can see.
* Listen carefully and notice five sounds you can hear.
* Notice five things you can physically feel.

You can develop this skill further by going for a daily walk and spending the whole time noticing what you can see, hear, smell and physically feel (and refocusing whenever you realize you’ve been ‘disconnected’).

### Connect With Your Morning Routine

Pick an activity that’s a part of your daily morning routine, such as brushing your teeth, combing your hair or taking a shower. Totally focus on what you are doing, using all your five senses. For example, when you’re in the shower notice how the water sounds when it sprays out of the nozzle, the temperature of the water and how it feels when it hits your body, and the smell of the shampoo in your hair. When your mind begins to wander during the habit, acknowledge that your mind wandered and refocus back on the five senses when doing the activity.

## Conclusion

I like to consider these types of activities mini-meditations. Sometimes it only takes a small activity to help ease stress slightly, and we can all take every bit of relief we can get right now.
