Sometimes our brains can ruminate endlessly on narratives we'd rather not listen to on a regular basis. A technique to try and soothe these concerns is cognitive defusion. Note: defusion will not necessarily make the thoughts go away and make you feel better. You need to accept thoughts and not try to control/repress them. 

However, in general it has helped me. Some exercises that can be used to defuse thoughts are below:

### I’m Having the Thought That

To begin this exercise, first bring to mind an upsetting thought that takes the form ‘I am X’ (an example includes I am stupid). Preferably pick a thought that often recurs and bothers you when it does. Now hold that thought in your mind and actively believe it as much as you can. Focus on it for a bit and notice your response.

### Musical Thinking

Bring to mind a negative self-judgement that commonly bothers you when it comes up. Hold that thought in your mind and really believe it as much as you can for a few seconds. Then imagine taking that same thought and singing it to yourself to the tune of a catchy jingle, like Happy Birthday, Jingle Bells, . Sing it silently inside your head. Notice what happens.

### Naming Stories

Identify your mind’s favorite stories, then give them names, such as the *I'm an idiot* story. Usually, there will be a few variations on a story's theme. When your stories show up, be sure to acknowledge them by name. You don’t have to challenge it or push it away, nor do you have to give it much attention. Simply let it come and go as it pleases, while you channel your energy into doing something that matters to you.

### Silly Voices Technique

When your mind starts coming up with the stories you labeled in the previous part, simply thank it. Do not give the thanks in a sarcastic and/or aggressive manner - do it with warmth and humour, and with a genuine appreciation for the capacity your mind has to produce endless thoughts.

### Thank Mind
 
When dealing with recurrent negative thoughts, focus on the thought for a few seconds, believing it as much as possible. Then pick a cartoon character with a humorous voice, such as Spongebob, Mickey Mouse, or Bugs Bunny. Now bring the troubling thought to mind, but instead hear it in the cartoon character’s voice, as if that character were audibly saying your thoughts. This can also be done with characters from movies such as Darth Vader, Gollum or any character that has a distinct voice that you would find funny.

## Conclusion

Overall, being able to lower the volume on the negative narratives our brain tells ourselves has been a huge benefit to my well-being. If you struggle with that yourself, I recommend trying out some of these techniques.
