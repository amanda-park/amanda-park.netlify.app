You'll notice I haven't been blogging as much as of late. That's because I've decided that with the current place in my life that I’m at right now that it was worth trying to learn something far meatier that I've always been interested in - game development. 

Now, I've always had a desire to make a game, but it seemed nearly impossible to do. A few years ago, when I had a "great" idea, I didn't know:
* How to code
* How to create art
* How to make music
* What made a game great
* How to stick to something challenging *(the most important thing!)*

But things have changed:
* I wouldn't call myself an amazing coder, but I can do far more than I did a few years ago now that I have to code on a regular basis for my job. 
* I've taken an interest in pixel art and can now draw and modify some basic sprites (mostly humanoids). 
* I still can't really do much with music, but there are tools available now that can help with that (mainly using recurrent neural networks in Python). 
* I'm digesting a lot of information out there related to game design from books and YouTube channels.
* I adapted a growth mindset and accepted that you need to start somewhere to get good at something.

My next few posts on here will chronicle my overall experiences in learning the many layers of game development, and will likely elaborate on many of the points made here. 

Hope you all are looking forward to it!
