If you've read some of my posts you'll know that I've used online learning tools such as Coursera in the past to learn about topics of interest to me. Being in the field of data science, I know that the best tools for tackling challenging problems are constantly evolving, so it's basically a must that I continue to learn about new findings in the ever-expanding field of data analytics. 

One thing my organization did recently that I am incredibly grateful for is offering unlimited access to a site called LinkedIn Learning. There are thousands of classes on there geared towards professional development, whether it be in a creative pursuit or something more technically minded. 

I've worked through a few different tracks that have been really helpful for developing my skills. Some of these have included:
* Master Python for Data Science
* Master the Fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning
* Advance Your Skills in Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Each learning path has its own set of courses included, and they generally focus on the practical skills you need to know in order to use it successfully in a professional setting. I appreciate the emphasis on practicality rather than the theoretical underpinnings that regularly motivated my formal education experiences.

So why am I making this post? I just want to encourage you to also invest in yourself. There are going to be more careers than not that will be impacted by the technological revolution of AI, so if you're not in a direct person-facing role odds are higher than not that your job will be at risk of being partially (or fully) automated. 

Further, this investment doesn't need to be anything intimidating, either. 10 minutes a day, if done on a consistent basis, will lead to some pretty solid results when measured out over the course of a year. It gets easier if you do it every day, but doing it every day is the hard part.
