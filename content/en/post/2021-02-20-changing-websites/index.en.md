Hi everyone! This is an update post. Previously, I have been hosting my content on [https://amanda-park.github.io](https://amanda-park.github.io/), but I have switched from Github Pages to Netlify for hosting my personal website. Github will still be used, but it will be reserved for hosting documentation only. 

The new link I will be posting content on is [https://amanda-park.netlify.app/](https://amanda-park.netlify.app/).

## So Why Did I Change Websites?

There are a few reasons:

### **It Was Awkwardly Stitched Together** 

I had initially built a portfolio site roughly 2 years ago on using the github.io name after cloning a repo and messing around with the html and css. Roughly a year later I decided I wanted to add in a blog on top of that, which was deployed on Github Pages via Jekyll. These two things did not play well with each other. 

By putting everything under this new website umbrella, the look and feel of the website will be the same regardless of whether you're looking at my portfolio page or my blog. 

### More Flexible Blog Options

I recently began reading an [online book about blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-files.html) and realized how simple it was to build a website using Hugo through R. Given how comfortable I am navigating R at this point, it didn't take long to set up and get this new website rolling. 

So far I've noticed Hugo is more flexible than Jekyll was. Many things I had to add to Jekyll manually (for example, tags) are handled innately by writing a blog post in Markdown. Adding images or other outside content is also much simpler. And by far the nicest benefit of writing posts in RStudio is through the blogdown package, posts will automatically update in the viewer pane as you save your progress. 

Overall, it's just super duper convenient.
