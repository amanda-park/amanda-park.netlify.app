    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>During grad school, whenever I had free time I read many books about mental health. (Motivated by necessity - I was struggling to get by some days.) I learned a lot of useful information in these books that I felt would be useful to share with other people in some capacity.</p>
<p>I also realized that getting the job I wanted right out of grad school would be challenging. I identify myself as a generalist over a specialist, so I figured that building an app would be a helpful review of coding outside the programming language of R, which I exclusively used in school.</p>
<p>I then decided making an Android App was the answer. I would develop a guidebook that covered various mental health techniques for people to have on their phone when they needed it. Beyond hitting the aforementioned desires, it would also be a cool thing that I could tell others I built as well (both personally and professionally). If you want to check it out, you can download it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amanda.mentalhealthguide">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-i-followed">The Process I Followed</h2>
<p>I started off researching the best tools in order to build this app. The first programming class I took in undergrad involved coding in Java, so when I saw that was an option to build an app with, I jumped on it. I learned pretty quickly that when you don&rsquo;t code in a language for a few years, it can take a while to knock off the dust and get comfortable using the syntax of the language again.</p>
<p>Then I downloaded Android Studio. It&rsquo;s a powerful interface for developing apps, but I would not describe it as intuitive to a newcomer. There was a pretty hefty learning curve where I had to learn navigating the GUI and understanding both the formatting and location of files in an application.</p>
<p>I came across many different terms I had not heard before. Before building this app, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what the difference between a fragment and an activity was. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about user interface (UI) design prior to this, and through trial and error I learned what kept the app both functional and fast. I would by no means say I made the app pretty (I am a stick figure artist at heart), but I was happy with how it turned out visually.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-i-faced">The Challenges I Faced</h2>
<p>But before I became happy with how it turned out, I ran into a few major issues that I&rsquo;ve realized are endemic to many projects. You may recognize some of these in your own experiences, and perhaps they are a rite of passage that all developers have to learn eventually.</p>
<h3 id="scope-creep">Scope Creep</h3>
<p>I almost let my initial idea for an app become so complex that it stopped me from completing it. My app ended up with far more content than I ever intended it to initially. When I first started building it I wanted to focus on having just a few things available for people, and to build on if I was interested later with new features.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t happen, though. I decided that I should cover  more therapies and make the app more robust, which added to development time. An app that could have reasonably been completed months earlier wasn&rsquo;t because I decided I needed to tinker with it until it met my standards.</p>
<p>In hindsight, if I had planned this app out more carefully rather than put it together as I went, I could have avoided this scope creep. Now that I have experience working in a large-scale organization, I have also seen scope creep affect other projects and believe that I am better equipped to resist the pull of a &ldquo;bigger and better&rdquo; result.</p>
<h3 id="not-using-version-control">Not Using Version Control</h3>
<p>Yeah, I know. I can feel the glares coming through the screen. If you look in the GitHub repository of my code for this project, you&rsquo;ll see that there are old versions of files that are in there. However, I did not go out of my way to put them there. That only happened because Windows periodically backed up my save files, not because I went out of my way to do so.</p>
<p>(In newer versions of Android Studio version control is automatically built into the application. So perhaps I would have practiced better version control habits for reproducibility purpose had this feature been built in a year ago.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason this was a learning lesson because I lost time and progress because I didn&rsquo;t practice good version control habits. At one point, my strings.xml file had its format altered, and my app because unusable as a result. It took hours to fix a change that, with proper version control, I could have just reverted to a previous version in a minute. Sometimes you just have to learn those lessons the hard way to realize their importance, I suppose.</p>
<h3 id="not-commenting-well-enough">Not Commenting Well Enough</h3>
<p>This one plagued me when I took breaks between working on this project. I was lazy with commenting what new features I added to this application and just assumed I would remember what I was doing months ago. Unsurprisingly, I regularly forgot what changes I made and had to spend time re-learning something all over again, when commenting would have saved trouble in the long run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing looking back how little I kept track of what every step of my code did, and one of the major lessons learned I took away from this project was to comment any future work thoroughly in such a way that I would not be confused when I looked back at it later on. (Thankfully when using R it&rsquo;s easy to use R Markdown files, and when using Python Jupyter Notebooks allows for Markdown and code chunks. So it&rsquo;s become standard practice when I have to code on the job for me now, to the point of seeming excessive to my colleagues.)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I was content with how my app turned out. It was not a successful endeavor by traditional means (only my friends checked out the app), but I learned a lot of important lessons through this project, both in regards to coding and with building the discipline to pursue projects in the future (which I hope will help me stay consistent with this blog).</p>
