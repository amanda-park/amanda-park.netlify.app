    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>This past week has to undoubtedly be the worst week of my young professional career. Because of COVID-19, our analytics department had to make cuts, and some of my favorite coworkers were let go. While I&rsquo;m thankful to still have a job in a freefalling economy and health insurance in a pandemic, I can&rsquo;t help but feel awful for the people I worked with daily and got to know well over the past few months.</p>
<h3 id="the-anxiety-of-the-unknown">The Anxiety of the Unknown</h3>
<p>Of course, before the cuts were announced, I was <strong>very</strong> anxious about losing my job. The organization gave a two weeks heads up about impending cuts before they happened, and the closer I was to finding out my job status, the heavier of a toll it took mentally.</p>
<p>I started sleeping very poorly. My skin started breaking out like I was a teenager again. I struggled with digestive issues. I felt myself falling back into negative habits and patterns of thinking. Was my career going to have a &ldquo;Principal and the Pauper&rdquo; moment?</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/09_02.png" alt="At least my name isn&rsquo;t Armin Tamzarian."></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><em>At least my name isn&rsquo;t Armin Tamzarian.</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Well, that wasn&rsquo;t the case. My career for the time being is fine, and I don’t have to worry about finding a job right now. It turns out my imposter syndrome was wrong and management actually liked me; who knew?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also been very bittersweet. My job had already shifted away from an office to working entirely from home due to COVID-19, and that has made it harder to connect with coworkers. Now having to watch them lose their jobs while not being present physically made things sting even more.</p>
<h3 id="the-inevitability-of-change">The Inevitability of Change</h3>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anything I&rsquo;ve learned over the last couple of years it&rsquo;s that nothing can stay the same forever. Change is indeed the only constant. I thought I was in a stable work situation being in healthcare analytics. My leadership had even said as much just a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>But one coronavirus later and now the script has been flipped. My department had to eat 30% cuts and overall hundreds of people within the organization lost their jobs. My workplace will never be the same.</p>
<p>For millennials such as myself, the idea of having a stable career in one position until retirement (like my dad did) was always an illusion. The workplace and economy just aren&rsquo;t what they used to be, even prior to the pandemic occurring. In order to get the best salary possible you practically need to hop jobs every couple of years to get anything beyond a cost of living raise (that barely covers inflation). You&rsquo;re incentivized against loyalty, at least if your ultimate goal of working is to make more money.</p>
<p>The world changes so quickly nowadays, and adaptability is the new name of the game. Whether it&rsquo;s by learning new skills or adjusting to changes in the workplace, there&rsquo;s a need to always be moving forward and getting better. In a lot of ways, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done over the past few years. Many parts of my personality I&rsquo;ve altered and refined, and I&rsquo;ve also learned the skillset that helped me obtain this job. I&rsquo;ve done a lot to grow these last few years, and I need to step back sometimes to acknowledge that I&rsquo;m not the same person I was even a year ago.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This week has been an intense emotional roller coaster. There have been many heavy emotions such as anger, grief, sadness, anxiety, surprise, and disgust. I&rsquo;m doing my best to actually work through those feelings rather than repress them and pretend everything is fine, but it&rsquo;s hard. And trying to juggle this all while sheltering in place and living alone has made it even harder. Just living in a world with COVID-19 and adjusting to working from home was challenging enough; adding severe job cuts has pushed it so that it actively requires I look out for my mental health to maintain my sanity.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m optimistic that this is a rock-bottom of sorts, at least for me personally. I can&rsquo;t control how the government and world at large reacts to the pandemic, so I try not to let it bother me. (Comments from the president suggesting injecting disinfectants to cure COVID-19 sure do piss me off to no end, though.) I still have a job that I like in the field I went to school for, and even though some of my favorite coworkers lost their jobs, the people that remain on the team I do enjoy working with. I&rsquo;m in a financially stable position and I have a good support system to keep me afloat during this time.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones, and for that I&rsquo;m grateful.</p>
