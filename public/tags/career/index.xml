      <description>I was officially exposed to the programming language R when I enrolled in my graduate program in 2017. Three years have passed, and now I feel much more comfortable navigating R than I did when I first started. The way I learned R was very bumpy, and looking back there were a lot of ways I could have improved and expedited developing my skills in the language. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write about this for anyone also interested in becoming proficient in R.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read some of my posts you&amp;rsquo;ll know that I&amp;rsquo;ve used online learning tools such as Coursera in the past to learn about topics of interest to me. Being in the field of data science, I know that the best tools for tackling challenging problems are constantly evolving, so it&amp;rsquo;s basically a must that I continue to learn about new findings in the ever-expanding field of data analytics.
One thing my organization did recently that I am incredibly grateful for is offering unlimited access to a site called LinkedIn Learning.</description>

      <description>Every now and again I&amp;rsquo;ll dabble in a free online class to see what I can learn from it, usually an MOOC from a site like Coursera or EdX. One I came across recently was called Mindshift, offered by Coursera and hosted by Barbara Oakley. I originally checked out her Coursera class &amp;ldquo;Learning How to Learn&amp;rdquo; between semesters in undergrad and found it very useful to understand the way our brain tries to comprehend things while obtaining my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>This is the general dilemma I know I went through when I was trying to figure out what degree path to go down. When I&amp;rsquo;ve been at the top of my game in school, most professors have told me Iâ€™m smart enough to go down whatever career path I wanted to. While it was nice for so many smart people to think I was also intelligent, it did absolutely nothing for me to help narrow down the avenues I could take my career.</description>
