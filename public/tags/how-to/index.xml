      <description>When I was completing my undergraduate degree, I was known for having strong writing skills. Even if I hated writing essays, I could make a persuasive argument and get the A I wanted.
However, after attending grad school and now being in the workforce, writing a piece that was at least 8 pages and had many sources to back up its argument isn&amp;rsquo;t valuable.
Instead, focused and technical writing prowess is valued.</description>

      <description>Sometimes our brains can ruminate endlessly on narratives we&amp;rsquo;d rather not listen to on a regular basis. A technique to try and soothe these concerns is cognitive defusion. Note: defusion will not necessarily make the thoughts go away and make you feel better. You need to accept thoughts and not try to control/repress them.
However, in general it has helped me. Some exercises that can be used to defuse thoughts are below:</description>

      <description>With the state of the world still being what it is, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel disconnected from our bodies. Grounding is a very important practice that we should all use on a regular basis, even when we&amp;rsquo;re not living through history. Below Iâ€™ll list a few of my favorite techniques I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past to stay in the present moment (these can be done in quick succession or separately, depending on personal preferences):</description>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten better at getting consistently good nights of sleep. Here are a few tips you can implement that may help you wake up ready to tackle the world when your alarm goes off:
Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day I know this one is the one I struggle with most personally. Growing up, I was always the type to sleep in on weekends as I never fully rested and awake when I woke up in the mornings for school.</description>

      <title>How To: Practice Psychological First Aid</title>
      <link>https://amanda-park.netlify.app/post/2020-05-03-psychological-first-aid/</link>

      <description>The goal of providing psychological first aid is to provide acute assistance to someone in crisis. It is a useful skill to have in any day and age, but the uncertainty of our current world makes it more critical than ever. George S.

      <title>How To: Develop Social Skills</title>

      <description>Growing up, I used to be very socially awkward. And not the type socially awkward that you see sometimes in media with nerdier women that comes across as being appealing to some. I was socially awkward in the &amp;ldquo;Wow, we want to actively avoid this person&amp;rdquo; way that led to a lot of self-doubt and angst until I was well into my 20s.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a years-long process to get to where I am now socially.</description>
