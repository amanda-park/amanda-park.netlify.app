      I was officially exposed to the programming language R when I enrolled in my graduate program in 2017. Three years have passed, and now I feel much more comfortable navigating R than I did when I first started. The way I learned R was very bumpy, and looking back there were a lot of ways I could have improved and expedited developing my skills in the language. I figured I&rsquo;d write about this for anyone also interested in becoming proficient in R.

      If you&rsquo;ve read some of my posts you&rsquo;ll know that I&rsquo;ve used online learning tools such as Coursera in the past to learn about topics of interest to me. Being in the field of data science, I know that the best tools for tackling challenging problems are constantly evolving, so it&rsquo;s basically a must that I continue to learn about new findings in the ever-expanding field of data analytics.
One thing my organization did recently that I am incredibly grateful for is offering unlimited access to a site called LinkedIn Learning.

      Every now and again I&rsquo;ll dabble in a free online class to see what I can learn from it, usually an MOOC from a site like Coursera or EdX. One I came across recently was called Mindshift, offered by Coursera and hosted by Barbara Oakley. I originally checked out her Coursera class &ldquo;Learning How to Learn&rdquo; between semesters in undergrad and found it very useful to understand the way our brain tries to comprehend things while obtaining my Bachelor&rsquo;s.

      This is the general dilemma I know I went through when I was trying to figure out what degree path to go down. When I&rsquo;ve been at the top of my game in school, most professors have told me I’m smart enough to go down whatever career path I wanted to. While it was nice for so many smart people to think I was also intelligent, it did absolutely nothing for me to help narrow down the avenues I could take my career.

      I know I haven&rsquo;t given much of an update on what I&rsquo;ve been working on or how I&rsquo;ve been doing - 2020 has definitely been a doozy on staying consistent with the blogging front. However, I have made a lot of progress on developing that skillset by working on a small game project. It&rsquo;s based on a hypothetical sidequest happening for a long-standing D&amp;D campaign I&rsquo;ve been a part of, called Edge of Chaos.

      Art is hard. I have a lot of respect for people who can do art in a professional capacity, as my level of drawing has barely evolved past stick figure drawings. I used to tell myself that there was no way that I was an artist and that the skills needed to draw were something that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to learn.
Well, at this point I still can&rsquo;t draw. But I took a baby step to becoming more comfortable with art, and started to learn about the mechanics of pixel art in particular.

      Probably one of the most important things you&rsquo;ll have to decide before making the game is what engine is most appropriate to do so in. For the longest time, I found making this choice very overwhelming, and I struggled with figuring out which would be most appropriate for me.
There are many choices out there for game development in 2020. There are the engines geared towards people who aren&rsquo;t coders, such as RPG Maker and Game Maker Studio.

Now, I&rsquo;ve always had a desire to make a game, but it seemed nearly impossible to do. A few years ago, when I had a &ldquo;great&rdquo; idea, I didn&rsquo;t know:

      Yesterday, I pulled off a 24 hour fast, where the only thing I consumed in the time frame was water. I&rsquo;ve previously experimented with intermittent fasting in grad school, where there&rsquo;s a specific time frame to eat, and for the rest of the time you only drink water. As I followed the 16:8 approach, I would abstain from food for 16 hours and then eat for 8. But this is the first time I&rsquo;ve deliberately pushed past the 16 hour time to go for an entire day&rsquo;s worth of fasting.

Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day I know this one is the one I struggle with most personally. Growing up, I was always the type to sleep in on weekends as I never fully rested and awake when I woke up in the mornings for school.

      The title of this post is in reference to one of the most frustrating things I&rsquo;ve heard intelligence people say. You cannot logically sleep when you&rsquo;re dead because you need to be alive to sleep. And yet this idea that you can sleep when it&rsquo;s all over lives on. Why? I want to give a few of my thoughts on that:
Workaholic Culture I&rsquo;m speaking primarily towards American culture (I know that work-life balance can be even worse in places like Japan and China), but Americans pride themselves on working hard and doing a good job when they do work hard.

      When I was completing my undergraduate degree, I was known for having strong writing skills. Even if I hated writing essays, I could make a persuasive argument and get the A I wanted.
However, after attending grad school and now being in the workforce, writing a piece that was at least 8 pages and had many sources to back up its argument isn&rsquo;t valuable.
Instead, focused and technical writing prowess is valued.

      Sometimes our brains can ruminate endlessly on narratives we&rsquo;d rather not listen to on a regular basis. A technique to try and soothe these concerns is cognitive defusion. Note: defusion will not necessarily make the thoughts go away and make you feel better. You need to accept thoughts and not try to control/repress them.
However, in general it has helped me. Some exercises that can be used to defuse thoughts are below:

As of today, I have two doses of the Pfizer vaccine injected in my arm. I believe in science and the efficacy of the vaccines, so I had no hesitation getting the shot at the moment it was offered.

      Art is hard. I have a lot of respect for people who can do art in a professional capacity, as my level of drawing has barely evolved past stick figure drawings. I used to tell myself that there was no way that I was an artist and that the skills needed to draw were something that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to learn.
Well, at this point I still can&rsquo;t draw. But I took a baby step to becoming more comfortable with art, and started to learn about the mechanics of pixel art in particular.

There are many choices out there for game development in 2020. There are the engines geared towards people who aren&rsquo;t coders, such as RPG Maker and Game Maker Studio.

      Yesterday, I pulled off a 24 hour fast, where the only thing I consumed in the time frame was water. I&rsquo;ve previously experimented with intermittent fasting in grad school, where there&rsquo;s a specific time frame to eat, and for the rest of the time you only drink water. As I followed the 16:8 approach, I would abstain from food for 16 hours and then eat for 8. But this is the first time I&rsquo;ve deliberately pushed past the 16 hour time to go for an entire day&rsquo;s worth of fasting.

        How To: Practice Cognitive Defusion
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Sometimes our brains can ruminate endlessly on narratives we&rsquo;d rather not listen to on a regular basis. A technique to try and soothe these concerns is cognitive defusion. Note: defusion will not necessarily make the thoughts go away and make you feel better. You need to accept thoughts and not try to control/repress them.
However, in general it has helped me. Some exercises that can be used to defuse thoughts are below:

        The Dangerous Impact of Social Media
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Over the years, I&rsquo;ve become increasingly unimpressed with the impact of social media on our lives. I&rsquo;ve found myself happier using online platforms on a limited basis, so I figured it&rsquo;d be worth talking about why I&rsquo;ve reduced my social media usage so much over the past few years.
It&rsquo;s Designed to be Addictive The goal of mainstream social media apps in 2020 is to keep your attention on the screen for as long as possible, in what is now known as the attention economy.

        How To: Stay Grounded Mentally

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      With the state of the world still being what it is, it&rsquo;s easy to feel disconnected from our bodies. Grounding is a very important practice that we should all use on a regular basis, even when we&rsquo;re not living through history. Below I’ll list a few of my favorite techniques I&rsquo;ve used in the past to stay in the present moment (these can be done in quick succession or separately, depending on personal preferences):

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Every now and again I&rsquo;ll dabble in a free online class to see what I can learn from it, usually an MOOC from a site like Coursera or EdX. One I came across recently was called Mindshift, offered by Coursera and hosted by Barbara Oakley. I originally checked out her Coursera class &ldquo;Learning How to Learn&rdquo; between semesters in undergrad and found it very useful to understand the way our brain tries to comprehend things while obtaining my Bachelor&rsquo;s.

        How To: Sleep Better

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Over the years I&rsquo;ve gotten better at getting consistently good nights of sleep. Here are a few tips you can implement that may help you wake up ready to tackle the world when your alarm goes off:
Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day I know this one is the one I struggle with most personally. Growing up, I was always the type to sleep in on weekends as I never fully rested and awake when I woke up in the mornings for school.

        You Can&#39;t Sleep When You&#39;re Dead

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The title of this post is in reference to one of the most frustrating things I&rsquo;ve heard intelligence people say. You cannot logically sleep when you&rsquo;re dead because you need to be alive to sleep. And yet this idea that you can sleep when it&rsquo;s all over lives on. Why? I want to give a few of my thoughts on that:
Workaholic Culture I&rsquo;m speaking primarily towards American culture (I know that work-life balance can be even worse in places like Japan and China), but Americans pride themselves on working hard and doing a good job when they do work hard.

      Growing up, I used to be very socially awkward. And not the type socially awkward that you see sometimes in media with nerdier women that comes across as being appealing to some. I was socially awkward in the &ldquo;Wow, we want to actively avoid this person&rdquo; way that led to a lot of self-doubt and angst until I was well into my 20s.
It&rsquo;s been a years-long process to get to where I am now socially.

        Thinking Statistically: When Data Visualizations Lie to You

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned by going into statistics as a career, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s so easy to &ldquo;lie&rdquo; with data. Visualizations are one of the easiest ways to get away with doing this and tell a story that in all actuality may not be true at all.
Edward Tufte was a statistician and artist, and he was acutely aware of this problem too. He&rsquo;s known for writing books such as The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, which is a classic regarding how to create statistical visualization.
